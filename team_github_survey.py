    ("Write and maintain clear contribution guidelines",
     "Add a CONTRIBUTING.md file that explains how to open issues, submit pull requests, follow code style, and communicate changes. This makes it easier for new and existing team members to contribute effectively and reduces confusion."),
    ("Track changes and improvements with a changelog and regular releases",
     "Use a CHANGELOG.md to document what's new, improved, or fixed in each update to our scripts, dashboards, or processes. For major changes, create GitHub releases so everyone knows what's changed and when."),

     "Store all team-specific documentation, onboarding checklists, process explanations, and FAQs in a dedicated docs/ folder. This makes it easy for new team members to get up to speed and for everyone to find answers quickly."),
    ("Use a data/ folder to store raw input files",
     "Keep all raw data files (such as downloaded CSVs, unprocessed reports, or source datasets) in a dedicated data/ folder. This keeps data organized and separate from scripts or outputs, making it easier to track data sources and avoid confusion."),
    ("Use a dist/ folder for generated outputs and reports",
     "Save all generated files (like cleaned datasets, final reports, or exported charts) in a dist/ folder. This helps everyone know where to find the latest results and keeps outputs separate from raw data and code."),
    ("Add a CHANGELOG.md and use GitHub releases for major updates",
     "Whenever we make significant changes to our scripts, dashboards, or processes, document them in a CHANGELOG.md and create a GitHub release. This provides a clear history of what's changed and helps with troubleshooting or onboarding.")
